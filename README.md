# Eye-excersise

this project makes a pair of eyes that will follow the mouse cursor around the page.

To run just download the files place them all in the same folder and double click or drag the html link into the browser and move your mouse around and watch the eyes go!

in the future i want to use this to make a game of some sort like redlight greenlight.
